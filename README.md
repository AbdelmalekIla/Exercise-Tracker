# Workout Tracker

## Objective

Build an exercise tracking app using natural language processing and Google sheets.

You **won't** be able to run this solution code as is. Why? You'll need to add **your own** API keys as environment variables first.

## PyCharm Environment Variables

In PyCharm you set your environment variables under "Edit Configurations". You should see a section called "Environment" -> "Environment Variables".
There, you can click a small symbol which brings up a window where you can paste all your environment variables at the same time.
The format follows the example of the env_for_pycharm file (use your own API keys)
